## 📚 About This Repo

#### This repo was created to help me learn about python as I learn more about ML, which can be found [*here*](https://github.com/rajin-khan/self-machine-learning).
This also serves as my personal learning log, featuring code snippets, projects, and notes as I delve deeper into Python programming. Whether it's mastering the basics or exploring advanced topics, this repo will evolve as my skills grow.
