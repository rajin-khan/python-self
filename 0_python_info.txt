in settings.json, code runner has to run python with " /usr/local/bin/python3 -u "filelocation" "
instead of " python -u "filelocation" "
this is because by default, "python" being called revers to 2.7, which is left intact becuase 
a lot of OS stuff depends on it. so don't change or uninstall this version.
best to just call that version of python when executing or interpreting.


instead of libraries and header files, we have modules in python that serve the same purpose.
so there's a math module, etc.

you get it in your program by:
" import *libraryname* "
that's literally it.

then libraryname is a class whose methods you can access.
for example if you did "import math"
then you would access the functions in the math library like you would access methods of a class, with the dot operator.
so:
"math.*nameofmethod*"
