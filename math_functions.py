import math #the same way header files worked in c, or classes did in java, you have modules in python
#modules are libraries you can import with pre-defined functions, and the name of each module acts as a class whose methods you can access.

result_1 = round(x)
result_2 = abs(x) #absolute value of x, so basically the positive of the number
result_3 = math.ceil(x)
result_4 = math.sqrt(x)
